# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 28th, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished Coursera's University of Michigan Python Course - Course 2: Python Data Structures : Week 5

**Thoughts** 
* Still burning through what is basically review material. I learned about using dict.get(key,defaultValue) as an idiom for creating histograms without throwing a traceback if you look for a key that isn't in the dictionary yet. I felt a little strange reviewing basics that I've known for a long time, but clearly without coding regularly there are still a lot of methods and constructions that are new to me with some of the most common elements of the standard library.
