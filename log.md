# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 28th, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress** 
* Finished Coursera's University of Michigan Python Course - Course 2: Python Data Structures : Week 5

**Thoughts** 
* Still burning through what is basically review material. I learned about using dict.get(key,defaultValue) as an idiom for creating histograms without throwing a traceback if you look for a key that isn't in the dictionary yet. I felt a little strange reviewing basics that I've known for a long time, but clearly without coding regularly there are still a lot of methods and constructions that are new to me with some of the most common elements of the standard library.

### Day 2: July 29th, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished Coursera's University of Michigan Python Course - Course 2: Python Data Structures
* Started Courera's University of Michigan Python Course - Course 3: Using Python to Access the Web: Weeks 1 and 2

**Thoughts**
* Got a better sense of how and when to use a tuple. Also learned that a major feature of tuples is that they're much more memory efficient because they hardle support any methods. 
* Figured out the difference between list.sort() and sorted()
* Really enjoyed watching interviews with the creators of jQuery and C++ and the "discoverer" of JSON.
* Also learned about "greedy" and "non-greedy" regex statements
* This part of the tutorial is still feeling relatively easy, though it takes me a minute to complete the exercises, especially the "just for fun" exercise which involved list comprehensions. Amazing, but for some reason sort of mind bending.

**Questions** 
* Study up on list comprehensions
* Learn more about primitives in different languages
* Learn more about the history of AJAX in different languages
